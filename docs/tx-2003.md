[Texas District Viewer](https://gis1.tlc.texas.gov/) provides previous redistricting proposals, but only > 2006. The backing FTP site has more info on the [README](ftp://ftpgis1.tlc.state.tx.us/DistrictViewer/readme.txt). Select a plan to load into the viewer via the Plans dropdown (render as either shaded or outline). Can load two plans at a time (one shaded / one outlined). More info on the [parent Texas Redistricting site](https://tlc.texas.gov/redist/data/data.html).

PLANC190 (Latino Task Force Congressional Proposal) looks like it may be close enough to previous district maps to use for this PoC. Downloaded into open-redist-TX. [Info on this plan here.](https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local_news/article/Latino-task-force-offers-their-own-redistricting-1338083.php)

Shapefiles from District Viewer are in WGS-84 projection.
Converted to lat/lon degrees (-180 <> 180) via Mapshaper > Console, then `mapshaper -proj wgs84`.
Then exported as GeoJSON.
